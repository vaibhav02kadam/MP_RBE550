   Check source code /Turtle_Graphics_Star_Pattern/turtle_star_victor_sierra.py


3. Recording of ROS Turtle Sim 

   Check the video at /ROS_Turtlesim_demo.mp4

4. Obstacle Field Demonstration
   Obstacle demonstration is developed in python3 pygame. Please run ```install_dependencies.sh`` if not done.

   The grid width height variables block size and obstacle occupancy is mentioned in ```/env_utils.py``` which in is imported in ```/obstacle_field_env.py```
   
   Run ```python3 obstacle_field_env.py```

   Obstacle Field 10% Occupancy

5. Introduction, Motion planning Post

      Hello everyone
      I'm Vaibhav Kadam. I am first year graduate student at RBE MS Robotics. I come from academia + Robotics industry background working as research assistant focused on "Control for Spherical Robots" and then as Robotics Engineer developing navigation stack focused on autonomy for floor cleaning robots at Peppermint Robots India. 
      Interesting motion planning applications I like about is the planning of Reconfigurable modular robots that collective complete a task configuring themselves into various different shapes in a resource constraint environments.
      Apart from robotics, I like exploring new places, meeting new people and watching movies.
      Thanks !
